# Prime-numbers-Matrix-using-queue-
This algorithm consider as an example to use queue and 2D array to make a prime array 

First we full our queue using a method that cheack the number if it was a prime or no 

If true>>>>>>put it in the queue 

else we discard it 

then we creat a two dimentiol array to put these prime numbers 

we make nested loop to full it and overit write some condition like 

if the queue is empty breck the loop etc 

This example for queue and 2d array .
